# LED-Detection

The goal of this project is to have an application for tracking status leds on controller boards over webcam.

## Requirements
The whole project is written in python 3.9 with a bundle of libraries, which are listet in requirements.txt.
To install those with pip just type:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you prefer conda you can easily run the setup.sh file to install all requirements using either conda or pip.
The code for that was copied from
