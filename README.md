# LED-Detection

![example workflow](https://github.com/morgenmuesli/LED-Detection/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

The goal of this project is to have an application for tracking status leds on controller boards over webcam.

## Requirements
The whole project is written in python 3.9 with a bundle of libraries, which are listet in requirements.txt.
To install those with pip just type:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you prefer conda you can easily run the setup.sh file to install all requirements using either conda or pip.
The code for that was copied from
[Syncing Conda Environments with requirements.txt (05.10.2021) Lee Hanchung](https://leehanchung.github.io/2021-08-04-conda-requirements/)

### Creating a virtual enviroment
We highly recommend to use a virtual environment such as pyenv or conda.
