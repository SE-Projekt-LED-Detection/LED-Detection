Usage
-----


The goal of this project is to have an application for tracking status LEDs on controller boards over webcam.

Requirements
------------
The whole project is written in python 3.9 with a bundle of libraries, which are listed in requirements.txt.
To install those with pip just type:

::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

If you prefer conda you can easily run the setup.sh file to install all requirements using either conda or pip.
The code for that was copied from

Creating a virtual environment
